fmio-dos
========

FM radio card manipulation utility (DOS port).

This is dirty port of http://jumbo.narod.ru/fmio.html to DOS.

Thanks to Vladimir Popov <jumbo@narod.ru> and OpenWatcom !

PS. 
- All kernel based FM modules was removed;
- default driver was changed and testing - works;
- help text was extend;
- use make.cmd from /src for build (Please setup Open Watcom first); 
- /arc contains original archive; 
- /bin contains pre-compiled DOS binary.

Kirill.
